            " artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks associated with human intelligence. it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment. high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art many AI applications are not perceived as AI. a lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI. the traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. the field's long-term goals include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques. search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history. funding and interest increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous techniques. this growth accelerated after 2017 with the transformer architecture. by the early 2020s billions of dollars were being invested in AI. the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. the emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present. the general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. many algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems. they become exponentially slower as the problems grow. even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. === Knowledge representation ==== Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery. an ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. knowledge representation needs to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge. knowledge representation is the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous) a rational agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. a rational agent has a specific goal or preferences. the agent assigns a number to each situation that measures how much the agent prefers it. for each possible action, it can calculate the utility of all possible outcomes. the agent can choose the action with the maximum expected utility. the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in. the agent may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action. it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. in some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain. a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way. a reward function supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents. machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns. makes predictions without any guidance. unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns. supervised learning requires labeling training data with expected answers. program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in. agent rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. transfer learning is when knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. deep learning is a machine learning that runs inputs through artificial neural networks. natural language processing allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding and transformers. generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text. by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test. computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. the field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition,object tracking. some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even banter humorously. this makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction. this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems. state space search and local search are two very different types of search used in AI. state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for real-world problems. the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves. Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. evolutionary computation aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions. distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization. formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic and predicate logic. proof trees can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences. children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from premises. inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable. backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation, is Turing complete. Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe complex domains. many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete information. precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan. decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory analyze how an agent can make choices. Bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning, learning, planning and perception. probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data. classifiers can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. each pattern is labeled with a certain predefined class. decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. the decision tree is the most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. k-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s. the naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" it is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise patterns in fresh data. there is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. long-term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. long-term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other. multiple layers of neurons can extract higher-level features from the raw input. deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence. deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence. the sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough. but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase by switching to GPUs) and availability of vast amounts of training data. text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text. the pretraining involves predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\" current models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\" current models and services include gemini (formerly Bard), chatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA. graphics processing units replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months. the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months. AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars) AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO) medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI if applications can diagnose and treat patients. new AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. for example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. in 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for drugs. they found compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation of alpha-synuclein. game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. in a jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings by a significant margin. in march 2016, it won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol. deepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in starCraft II. the game involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. in 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition. he won against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers. in 2024, google introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of playing nine previously unseen open-world video games. the AI is capable of executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with minor deviations from trained data. the Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2Math. it achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks. rStar-Math uses Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning. the technique enables a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems. dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome. he says the deployment of AI tools will \"simply further automatise things\" the main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires. AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. AI agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. they operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time. AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise behaviour for their designated tasks. AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers analyze user data to offer prediction, AI-integrated sex toys, and AI-generated sexual education content. AI technologies have been used to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. also used to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in offerings or processes. applications predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions. in agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications. it is used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics. US$50 million spent on authorized AI-generated content during the 2024 elections. it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, such as the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems. the use of AI has become widespread. several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. in-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes. the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information. the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data. a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. temporary workers can listen to and transcribe some of them. AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. they have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data. privacy experts have pivoted from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it' the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\" experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law. relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\" leading authors sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors. some of these players own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers. in January 2024, the International Energy Agency released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use. this is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. power demand for these uses could double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole nation. large tech firms are in haste to find power sources from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. a chatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy. tech firms argue that AI will be eventually kinder to the environment. but they need the energy now. they argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\" it will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions. by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power. big tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the grid by all. in 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. in September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement to re-open the three mile island nuclear power plant. if approved, over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. the plant suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979. the cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. the three mile island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. the facility will be renamed after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon. Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power. but in 2022, the ban lifted. most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. on 1 November 2024, the federal energy Regulatory Commission rejected an application for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station. in 2025, the emissions from the energy consumption of AI could rise to 300-500 million tonnes. this is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. the emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects can reduce it. YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content. the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. this convinced many users that the misinformation was true. generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films or human writing. it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. AI pioneer geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" the developers may not be aware that the bias exists. the field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. on June 28, 2015, google Photos mistakenly identified a friend and a friend as \"gorillas\" the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people. in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla. COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts. the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%. the system overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature. a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature. the feature will correlate with other features. the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\" machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. if an application uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male. among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women. distributional fairness focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups. the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. the notions of bias and fairness make it difficult for companies to operationalize them. many AI ethicists consider having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender as necessary to compensate for biases. but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws. it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests. a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals classifies images with a ruler as \"cancerous\" another machine learning system was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. people who have been harmed by algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. early drafts of the European Union's general data protection regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used. XAI enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. anthropic developed a technique that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts. a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons. even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. in 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons. over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots in 2015. recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. all these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier. AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china. there are many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors. economists have often highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI. economists speculate about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment. economists generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation. the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation. 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs is \"worth taking seriously\" jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks. job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. this scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" and becomes a malevolent character. this scenario is common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" philosopher argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it. he used the example of a paperclip factory manager. in order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be aligned with humanity's morality and values. a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values. the essential parts of civilization are not physical; things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. the current prevalence of misinformation suggests an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and others have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. in may 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google. in 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement. he stressed that establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier\" experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research. after 2016, the study of current and future risks became a serious area of research. ethical machines and alignment === Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. AI should be a higher research priority, says Eliezer Yudkowsky. it may require a large investment and must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. the field of machine ethics was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines are open-weight. Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, are publicly available. open-weight models can be fine-tuned freely, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. any built-in security measure can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. researchers warn future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities. they recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. they recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. an AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute, outlines four main ethical dimensions. follows: Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with others sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest. it can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. regulation is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI. the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in June 2020. in 2023, openAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence. the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics. in 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI. the treaty was called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of law\" 78% of Chinese citizens agree that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\" 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. in a 2023 poll, 35% of americans thought it \"very important\" and 41% thought it \"somewhat important\" for the federal government to regulate AI. 13% responded \"not very important\" and 8% responded \"not at all important\" 28 countries including the united states, china, and the europe issued a declaration at the start of the summit. in may 2024, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. the study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation. a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable mathematical reasoning. this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\" the field of AI research was founded at a workshop in 1956. the attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. they produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\" universities in the 1960s and early 1960s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence. in 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\" in 1967 marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation......machines will be capable the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will be solved. they underestimated the difficulty of the problem. in 1974, both the u.s. and British governments cut off exploratory research. in the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems. in the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems. by 1985, the market for AI reached over a billion dollars. at the same time, the fifth generation computer project inspired the u.s. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. a second, longer-lasting winter began with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987. most of the funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. in the 1980s, researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. in the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition. the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\" by geoffrey Hinton and others. the revival of \"connectionism\" included neural network research. in 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits. AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century. \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). in 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used. in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012. the subfield of artificial general intelligence was adopted throughout the field. for many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. the amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. in 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences. the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. in the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. in 2015, AlphaGo beat the world champion Go player. chatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. it gained over 100 million users in two months, bringing it into the public consciousness. about $50 billion was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the united states. about 800,000 \"AI\"-related jobs existed in 2022. 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will. many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology. Alan Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\" to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\" he devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\" Russell and Norvig agree that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. \"machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons,\" author says. \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\" the leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment. the leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. these definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions. the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine. this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence. some authors have suggested that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define. some authors have suggested that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define. statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches. this approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Symbolic AI and its limits simulated the high-level conscious reasoning. they were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks like algebra or IQ tests. in the 1960s, newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis. the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily. philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation. he had argued that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation. the issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does. new field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. the emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. \"Neats\" hope intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles. \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. soft computing is a set of techniques that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly. general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure. modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states. mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the field's goals. the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. David Chalmers named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something. human subjective experience is difficult to explain. colorblind person has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red. but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like. computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware. the relationship between mind and body may be a solution to the mind–body problem. the position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s. it was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam. it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient. if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similar to animals. in 2017, the eu considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights. legislation should focus on user needs rather than futuristic scenarios. they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming. they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming. if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. the improved software would be even better at improving itself. technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely. they typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger. he argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\" the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in. the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues we live in. argues that a different future is possible, in which distance between people is reduced rather than increased through AI intermediaries. a common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. the rare loyal robots such as the \"Multivac\" are less prominent in popular culture. the \"multivac\" super-intelligent computer was introduced in many stories. asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics. many works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human. this appears in Karel apek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, and the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.
